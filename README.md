# Engineering Career Irtiqa (Ladder/Growth)  - Expectations at each level from Engineering team

#### TL;DR:

As a general rule of thumb, we will not unnecessarily scale our engineering team. Small teams are more productive, competitive. Everyone in the team knows their role and everyone wants to work with competitive people. In small team it is easier to understand/rectify the issues and resolutions are easier too. We believe that engineering teams don't always need a manager, as everyone in the team is competitive enough to manage themselves.

For year 2024, Team Ehsaan will have the following three roles. We can improve as the engineering team scales. For a small engineering team up-to 10 people, this seems like an ideal hierarchy.

| **Role** | **Description** |
| ---| --- |
| Engineer | Creating solutions to business problems |
| Senior Engineer | Handling most complex parts and mentoring |
| Engineering Lead | He may handle people management aspects |

Every role will have the following three parameters that each peer in the team will be working:

(re-phrase)

1. Skills
2. Engagement
3. Coachability -- Every resource is coachable at any given ladder and is either coaching or being coached at the same time.
